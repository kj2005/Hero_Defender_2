-----------------------------------------------------

Using:

1) Shaders
1.1)The "Use depth" on the material from the custom shaders is responsible for the depths of the material.
1.2)Materials are not displayed if you don't use depth in your Graphics Settings (disable depth or use checkmark "Depth off?" in the materials).
1.3)Use "Center glow"[MaterialToggle] only with particle system. This option is used to darken the main texture with a white texture (white is visible, black is invisible).
    If you turn on this feature, you need to use "Custom vertex stream" (Uv0.Custom.xy) in tab "Render".
    And don't forget to use "Custom data" parameters in your PS.
1.4)The Electricity shader is similar to "dissolve" shader. A mask is a texture that is distorted by noise.
	The noise texture in the shader is divided into two textures with different speeds - Use "Speed X/Y" value for first texture and "Z/W" for second texture.
1.5)DistortTexture shader. The noise texture is used to distort the main texture. 
    The texture of the mask only affects noise. The main texture won't be distorted in the black places of the mask.
1.6)Lit_CenterGlow shader. It's a simple opaque shader with emission.
1.7)Blend_LitGlow shader. The same shader as a blend shader, but with lit glowing. The shader takes light from all lights from the scene(not working with LWRP).

2)Light.
2.1)You can disable light in the main effect component (delete light and disable light in PS). 
    Light strongly loads the game if you don't use light probes or something else.

3)Scripts
3.1) Use "ParticleCollisionInstance" script with particle system. It works if you turn on "Send Collision Messages " in the particle system (Collision tab).

-----------------------------------------------------
The package uses "Bloom" from the standard Post Processing Stack. If you have any problems with "Bloom" - update PPS Asset from the Asset Store.
